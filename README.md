A project I did for IB Math (HL 1). Includes RSA key generation, Encryption, Decryption and Brute force factorizing.

Encryption and Key generation done through `driver.py`, while decryption is done through `decrypt.py`
An unrelated file, called `bruteforce.py` will factorize a number to its 2 prime factors, if they exist.
Paper I wrote on this topic [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzDRGkEPTyY_NlhiMUZKdlRWSFU/view?usp=sharing).

This is written in python2.7.
