A project I did for IB Math (HL 1). Includes RSA key generation, Encryption, Decryption and Brute force factorizing.

Encryption and Key generation done through `driver.py`, while decryption is done through `decrypt.py`
Paper I wrote about this here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/19QXb6Bfhqqq7mc4qq0aEq7FcZWAMjO_yqgJEqmCNUeo/edit?usp=sharing
